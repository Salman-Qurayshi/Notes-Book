# 📚 Notes Book

This repository contains my learning notes from topics across AI, DevOps, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Python, Linux, Networking, and more.

Each `.md` file here is a standalone topic, and many of them include visual diagrams and screenshots. For the cleanest experience, use the Notion version above — GitHub Pages is simple and limited in style.

## 🗂 Topics Included

- [AI Notes](ai.md)
- [Cloud & SysOps](cloud-sysops.md)
- [Concepts](concepts.md)
- [DevOps](devops.md)
- [Linux](linux.md)
- [Networking](networking.md)
- [Offensive Security](offensive.md)
- [Python](python.md)
- [Tools Resources](tools-resources.md)
- [Tools (2023–2024)](tools-2023-2024.md)

## 🖼 Images

All referenced images are inside the `images/` folder. If you're browsing this repo directly, they might not render properly. Use the Notion version for correct image placement.

## 🔧 About This Repo

This is a personal knowledge base built over the course of my diploma and hands-on experience. It serves as both:
- A reference for revision
- A resource for others getting into similar domains

I’ve cleaned up filenames and grouped images, but GitHub Markdown has limitations. Feel free to fork, star, or explore!
